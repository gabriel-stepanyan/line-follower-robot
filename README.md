# Line Follower Robot

## Description
This project was initially inspired by industrial-purpose LFRs.
  
Its aim is to simulate their main purpose - following a line on a surface - in this case - black on white.

The robot's schematic and algorithm are implemented using an Arduino Uno R3 board analogue.  
See other components in the schematics folder.

## Current Project Goals
- add 2 more infrared sensor modules to the robot  
- implement on/off control algorithm for the new configuration  
- implement PID control algorithm for the new configuration
