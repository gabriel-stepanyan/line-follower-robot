# Line Follower Robot

## Description
This project was initially inspired by industrial-purpose LFRs.
  
Its aim is to simulate their main purpose - following a line on a surface - in this case - black on white. 

The robot's schematic and algorithm are implemented using an Arduino Uno R3 board analogue.  
See other components in the schematics folder.

2 improved versions of the robot have been developed to show and compare the differences between an on-off algorithm and a PID algorithm for line following. 

## Future
Further improvements to version 2 of the robot could include:
- improvement and perfection of PID algorithm's tuning
- addition of a Bluetooth module for easier tuning
