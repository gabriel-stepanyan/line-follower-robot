# Line Follower Robot

## Description
This project was initially inspired by industrial-purpose LFRs.
  
Its aim is to simulate their main purpose - following a line on a surface - in this case - black on white.

The robot's schematic and algorithm are implemented using an Arduino Uno R3 board analogue.  
See other components in the corresponding schematics folder. Schematics were created using [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/).

## Current Project Goals
• add 2 more infrared sensor modules to the robot  
• implement on/off control algorithm for the new configuration  
• implement PID control algorithm for the new configuration
